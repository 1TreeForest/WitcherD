<h2><a name="addWPSClient_Info"></a>Add WPS Client</h2>

<p>This page explains what WPS is and tells users how to identify a WPS client.</p>

<P>When you click the <em>Next</em> button,  a wizard helps you connect easily to the Wireless Access Point through
WiFi Protected Setup (WPS).</p>

<h2><a name="AddWPSClient_SelectMethod"></a>Select a Setup Method</h2>

<p>This page lets user add a wireless client either through a Push Button; or by entering a PIN number. The Push Button method is selected by default when this page comes up. If the Push Button is selected, a push button will be desplayed on the screen to initiate the action. The PIN Number method requires user to enter the wireless client’s PIN, which should be prompted on the client’s utility GUI. Push Button is easier but PIN Number is more secured to add a wireless client.</p>

<p>If users click the “PIN Number” radio button, a text box shows up to ask the user to enter the PIN of the client. Users should see this 8-digit PIN from the client’s utility GUI when they start the WPS process at the client.</p>

<p>If the user goes to the 'Add WPS Client' page and starts the WPS process to add a client again with either Push Button or PIN method, the previously uncompleted WPS process is stopped and a new WPS process is started. This is also true if the user closes and re-starts the browser before the WPS process is complete.</p>

<p>When WPS process is going on, user cannot change the wireless settings of the AP.</p>

<h2><a name="AddWPSClient_SuccessSettingsUnchanged"></a>Add WPS Client - Success</h2>

<p>This page displays the WPS client connection success details as shown below:</p>

<p>The wireless client 'name'(MAC address) has been added to network successfully.</p>

<p>Click OK to go back to the Wi-Fi Protected Setup Page...</p>

<p>The name is the NetBIOS name of the client (if available) followed by the MAC address of the client. In this case there is no change in the AP wireless settings</p>


<h2><a name="AddWPSClient_SuccessSettingsChanged">Add WPS Client - Success (Settings Changed)</a></h2>

<p>When the WPS process starts, if the AP is not in the WPS Configured state (i.e. WPS unconfigured), the following message will appear on success:</p>

<p>The wireless client(MAC Address) has</p>
<p>been added to network successfully.</p>
<p>Note: The wireless settings have been changed</p> 
<p>Click OK to check new wireless settings...</p>

<p> A new wireless settings will be generated automatically, including the SSID, wireless security set to WPA & WPA2-PSK mixed mode. Note that as long as the AP is in the WPS Unconfigured state, even if there is an SSID and WPA passphrase configured, starting the WPS process will generate random SSID and change the security mode to WPA & WPA2-PSK mixed mode.</p>

<p>A random SSID is in the format of NTGR_<MAC Address-random string>, where 'random string' is a random string of 3 characters.</p>

<p>A random WPA & WPA2-PSK is a hexa decimal string of length 64.</p>


<h2><a name="AddWPSClient_InvalidPIN"></a>Add WPS Client - Invalid PIN</h2>


<p>The invalid PIN message appears when the PIN entered by the user at the 'Add WPS Client' page does not match with the PIN of WPS wireless client presented.</p>

<p>User should be able to see this 8-digit PIN from the client’s utility GUI when they start the WPS process at the client. </p>


<h2><a name="AddWPSClient_Cancel"></a>Add WPS Client - Cancel</h2>


<p>When the user clicks the <em>Cancel</em> button before the WPS process is done, no new WPS client will be added.</p>


<h2><a name="AddWPSClient_SecurityRisk"></a>Add WPS Client - Security Risk</h2>


<p>When more than one client with Push Button pressed, the AP will complete the WPS process because of a security risk.</p>


<p>In this case, check if there are any other clients with Push Button pressed. Re-start the WPS process after a few minutes.</p>

<h2><a name="AddWPSClient_Timeout"></a>Add WPS Client - Timeout</h2>

<p>Timeout happens if the AP cannot find any WPS wireless client or the AP somehow fails to add a WPS wireless client in the 2 -minutes window for the Push Button method or 4 -minutes window for the PIN method.


<p>In this case, check whether the client supports the WPS function. Refer to the Add WPS Client page for more information.</p>
